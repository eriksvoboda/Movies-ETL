# Movies ETL

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to refactor the code that was used to clean the wiki data, kaggel metadata, and the ratings data indvidually and create one function that takes all three of the files into account. As well las adding the data into a PostgreSQL database. 

Due to an error I made in the code from the module, which I fixed in the challenge, I had to drop both the ratings and movies tables from the database. The screen shots of the rows are from the new imports done in the challenge.
